This is FastAPI application which is Dockerised.

This API was created for GUI developement of Detectron2 - Mask RCNN-missile parts detection custom trained model.  

Upon setting up, this creates a API endpoint that takes image of missile as an input and gives JSON output which contains: 
Image data of masked/segmented image, names of detected classes, info about which pixel belongs to which detected class. 

When uploaded on AWS -EC2 cloud service, the service creates a public port which can be connected to the website backend for GUI developement of computer vision model. 

.pth file generated by custom training the model are not included in this git repo cause of size constriants. 
This file is to be uploaded in 'model' directory after custom training of the model is done.
